                <h3>A Dog's Purpose</h3>
                <blockquote>
                <p>This movie is based on W. Bruce Cameron's comedic novel about a 
                    dog's journey through several lives, with all different sorts of human companions. 
                    Voiced by Josh Gad, the dog is first a puppy that's picked up and euthanized by animal 
                    control. His first meaningful life is as Bailey, a golden retriever that ends up 
                    adopted by only child Ethan (Bryce Gheisar) and his mother (Juliet Rylance). Bailey and 
                    Ethan enjoy a close relationship that continues as Ethan grows into adolescence (K.J. 
                    Apa) and eventually becomes a star football player in the 1960s. Bailey even plays a 
                    part in helping Ethan find his first serious girlfriend, Hannah (Britt Robertson). 
                    But after family and personal tragedy strike, Bailey eventually dies of old age. He's 
                    then reincarnated as Ellie, a K-9 German shepherd partnered with cop Carlos (John Ortiz) in the 1970s. The dog fulfills its life cycle again and again until the 
                    2000s, when circumstances bring him full circle.</p>

                <h3>John Wick</h3><br>
                <blockquote>
                <p>This movie is all about a Legendary assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) 
                    retired from his violent career after marrying the love of his life. 
                    Her sudden death leaves John in deep mourning. When sadistic mobster 
                    Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) and his thugs steal John's prized car and 
                    kill the puppy that was a last gift from his wife, John unleashes the 
                    remorseless killing machine within and seeks vengeance. Meanwhile, Iosef's 
                    father (Michael Nyqvist) -- John's former colleague -- puts a huge bounty 
                    on John's head.</p>

                <h3>The Walking Dead</h3><br>
                <blockquote>
                <p>This series is an American post-apocalyptic horror television series based on the 
                    comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and 
                    Charlie Adlard. The series features a large ensemble cast as survivors 
                    of a zombie apocalypse, trying to stay alive under near-constant threat 
                    of attacks from zombies, colloquially known as "walkers". However, with 
                    the fall of humanity, these survivors also face conflict from other living 
                    survivors who have formed groups and communities with their own sets of laws 
                    and morals, often leading to hostile conflict between the human communities. 
                    Andrew Lincoln played the series's lead character, Rick Grimes, until his 
                    departure during the ninth season. Other long-standing cast members have 
                    included Norman Reedus, Steven Yeun, Chandler Riggs, Melissa McBride, Lauren 
                    Cohan, Danai Gurira, Josh McDermitt and Christian Serratos.</p>

                <h3>Lucifer</h3>
                <blockquote>
                <p>This series focuses on Lucifer Morningstar (Tom Ellis), a handsome and 
                    powerful angel who was cast out of Heaven for his betrayal. As the Devil, 
                    Lucifer tires of the millennia he's spent being the Lord of Hell, punishing 
                    people. Becoming increasingly bored and unhappy with his life in Hell, he 
                    resigns his throne in defiance of his father (God) and abandons his kingdom 
                    for Los Angeles, where he runs his own nightclub called "Lux". When he finds 
                    himself involved in a murder investigation, he meets the intriguing Detective 
                    Chloe Decker (Lauren German). After helping the LAPD solve the case by using his 
                    power to manipulate humans into revealing their deepest desires, he accepts a 
                    subsequent invitation to become a consultant to the department. Throughout the 
                    series, he learns he's changing into someone who is diametrically different than 
                    the devil he is. But with his stubbornness and selfishness, he ends up getting 
                    Detective Decker confused about his true being. As the events unfold, several 
                    celestial and demonic threats come to Los Angeles; at the same time, Lucifer and 
                    Chloe ultimately allow their love for each other to bring them through the darkness.</p>

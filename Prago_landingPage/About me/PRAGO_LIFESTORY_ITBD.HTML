    		<p><i>Hello</i> there, My name is <em>Jhimwel Juan Prago</em>.<sup>1</sup> I am born on <em>December 26, 2000</em>, and yeah it was the day after Christmas.<sup>2</sup> Because of that I usually get told that <q>After christ was born the devil follows the day after</q> but that is ok, I totally find it funny.<sup>3</sup> I am born in Metro manila in our house.<sup>4</sup> But I lived my childhood years in our province <em>Cagayan valley</em>.<sup>5</sup> My life there is not so easy because Our family has a huge money debt and Because of that, I experience a lot of things.<sup>6</sup> One of those things is <q>Farming</q>.<sup>7</sup> After going to school in the morning, I'll directly go to the farm that I am serving in the afternoon so that I could earn some money for myself.<sup>8</sup> I do all our household chores because my parents are always busy with their work.<sup>9</sup> I have a little brother and at that time he was just 2 years old and I am the one who is taking care of him as soon as he turned 1 year old.<sup>10</sup> But when I have school my parents took him to their work because no one will watch him I only took care of my brother in my summer.<sup>11</sup> but that didn't stop me from enjoying my childhood.<sup>12</sup> Because even though our parents were in debt of money they did not tell us.<sup>13</sup> Given that problem, my parents still buy us delicious food and things we need at that time I didn't know my parents have a huge problem that is I am so greedy at things I will cry when they did not want to buy me what I want.<sup>14</sup> Until one day my mom leaves our home and she took my little brother with her that shook me and my father because they left no trace.<sup>15</sup> That day I thought My mother and little brother were gone for good we can't find them.<sup>16</sup> As the day has passed my grandmother (mother of my father) called my father they said that my mother and little brother were there that ease us because my mother explained to my father why she left.<sup>17</sup> Late on I spend 2 years living only with my father and it is hard because I miss my mother a lot and I don't know why she leaves only my father knows it.<sup>18</sup> then My father decided that he will go to our grandmother to follow my mother and leave me behind with my grandmother because of some serious consequences of what my mother did.<sup>19</sup> Then my grandma came to take care of me and it was the best that happened in my life.<sup>20</sup>

    		<p><i>I've</i> spend my teenage years here in metro manila with my Grandmother, Little brother, and Grandfather because my mother and father decided to take me for the reason that they will leave this country to find a job abroad.<sup>1</sup> By that, they explained to me a lot of things like when my mother left us the reasons behind all of that are my mother make a huge debt in terms of money and she didn't notice it until there are so many people charging her and she felt depressed that is why she leaves us.<sup>2</sup> That is the reason why the two of them will go abroad leaving us two with our grandparents even though it hurts me a lot but I still understand why they have to leave us.<sup>2</sup> Both of them goes to Singapore and had a decent job to support me and my brother also to pay their debt.<sup>4</sup> I continued my studies here in Caloocan starting in grade 7 with that I have so many troubles in school because of my skin color, I am burnt and I have diabetes causing my neck to have some skin problem because of that I get too many criticisms.<sup>5</sup> And that takes down my confidence as a student that is why I spend half of my teenage days being an introverted person and it was hard because compare to my childhood I was an extrovert.<sup>6</sup> The transition from <del>extrovert</del> to <ins>introvert</ins> was hard but having no friends make it a little easy but because of that I have a poor performance at school making my marks low on every subject but I still pass it with not more than 79 and not less than 75 but to make it short I have a 77 <abbr title="General Weighted Average">GWA</abbr>.<sup>7</sup> Though I am not a smart child I can do better than 77 <abbr title="General Weighted Average">GWA</abbr>.<sup>8</sup> Then my grade 9 days have come in this year I had met many people that became my friends with that I gained my self back.<sup>9</sup> I performed better in academics and can now express myself better but the discrimination didn't stop even my friends tease me but even though it hurts my feelings I just keep telling my self that <q>Maybe they did not mean that and this is better than not having a friend</q> by that I still have them as my friends.<sup>10</sup> After having friends since grade 9 help me cope with my studies here I finished JHS rank 6 in our class.<sup>11</sup> In my SHS I studied <abbr title="Information Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> at STI college Caloocan.<sup>12</sup> Choosing my career path is not easy because I have struggled in identifying my field of expertise.<sup>13</sup> I did choose <abbr title="Information Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> because I am good at computer games and they say that <abbr title="Information Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>-related courses do not have math.<sup>14</sup> So that is why I indeed pursue this career.<sup>15</sup> At first, I find <abbr title="Information Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> subjects troublesome mostly programming subjects because I don't have the slightest clue what is it.<sup>16</sup> But as time goes by I am learning little by little what is programming is for thanks for the help of my teachers and some Indian YouTubers for their tutorial online.<sup>17</sup> In this time I experience being good at one thing and that is in programming because maybe I am built for this career.<sup>18</sup> Because in grade 12 I find programming fun and I like it a lot.<sup>19</sup> Then after our job immersion, I got employed by government people.<sup>20</sup> In that job, I experience being a personal IT and it was fun and I gained a lot of experience and learned a lot.<sup>21</sup>

    		<p><i>The</i> thing I feared the most in my life is studying in college.<sup>1</sup> Because I think there is too much responsibility for it and failing is not an option.<sup>2</sup> My parents put a lot of pressure on me in terms of my future but not on my grades.<sup>3</sup> They just care about my future so that I must finish my study and never fail in college that is my mindset right now.<sup>4</sup> I had Struggles choosing what university I will choose.<sup>5</sup> I didn't continue on STI because they say that <q>University is much better than colleges</q> so that is why I did researches what University has a good education in IT.<sup>6</sup> That is when the Univesity of the East appears but it was my 2nd choice because I did consider our family status because tuition fees in <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> can be troublesome for my parents.<sup>7</sup> So that is why I first tried on <abbr title="polytechnic university of the philippines">PUP</abbr> but I failed in their entrance exam.<sup>8</sup> That is why even though the tuition fee in <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> is expensive for us I still tell my parents that I want to study here but I expect that they will not agree with my idea.<sup>9</sup> But they actually agree with it at first it shook me because I can't believe it.<sup>10</sup> The downside is they have conditions.<sup>11</sup> First is I will study hard to graduate.<sup>12</sup> Second is I must not have vices.<sup>13</sup> lastly is get a decent job when I graduate.<sup>14</sup> I had agreed with them because I have trust in myself and I think I will not fail their expectation although I am not a fan of expectation what can I do I had accepted their terms.<sup>14</sup> So that is why I am studying here at UE.<sup>15</sup> College life here in <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> goes very well so far I have met 9 peoples who are my friends which felt like my family.<sup>16</sup> They are so dependable and they help me cope up with my studies that is why I am very thankful that I study here in <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> manila instead of <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> caloocan.<sup>17</sup>  Currently, My college life is at its best.<sup>18</sup> Having a teacher that is good at teaching is a huge blessing in studying so that is why I haven't yet regretted coming to <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> to entrust my college life.<sup>19</sup> I hope I can finish all of it without failing that being said <strong>I will be doing my very best to finish your subject ma'am and hopefully get high grades to continue my scholarship here in UE</strong>.<sup>20</sup>
